## Signature database

OWASP Web Malware Scanner uses a community-driven malware signature database to detect malwares. Signatures are found under the signatures/ folder. Each signature must be a text
file, that contains the following JSON object:

```
{
  "Database_Name": "Generic malware database",
  "Database_Signatures": [
    {
      "Malware_Name": "Generic PHP Malware",
      "Malware_Signatures": ["function.*for.*strlen.*isset"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The 'Database_Signatures' object must be an array of objects that must contains the malware name (Malware_Name) and the signature's array of regular expressions (Malware_Signatures). If the content of a file matches one of these regular expression, it will be marked as infected.

The signatures for PHP files are in 'signatures/php/'. The signatures for Javascript files are in 'signatures/js/'.

OWASP Web Malware Scanner also performs md5 file checksums. MD5 file signatures are in 'signatures/checksum/'. A MD5 signature database must be a text file that contains the following JSON object:

```
{
  "Database_Name": "Generic malware hash database",
  "Database_Hash": [
    {
      "Malware_Name": "Zip.Trojan.Container",
      "Malware_Hash": "e27122ba785627fca79b4a19c8eea38b"
    }
  ]
}
```

The 'Database_Hash' object must be an array of objects that must contain the MD5 hash (Malware_Hash) and the Malware name (Malware_Name). If the MD5 checksum of a file matches one of these MD5 hashes, it will be marked as infected.

You are welcome to contribute to this project by adding new signatures to this database.
