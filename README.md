## Signature database

WMS uses a community-driven malware signature database to detect malwares. Signatures are found under the signatures/ folder. Each signature is a text
file, that contains the following JSON object:

```
{
  "Malware_Name": "Backdoor 001",
  "Malware_Description": "Backdoor 001 is a common backdoor",
  "Malware_Signatures": ["\\x7ainf\\x6ca\\x74\\x65"]
}
```

The 'Malware_Signatures' object must be an array of regular expressions. If the content of a file matches one of these regular expression, it will be marked as infected.

The signatures for PHP files are in 'signatures/php/'. The signatures for Javascript files are in 'signatures/js/'.

You are welcome to contribute to this project by adding new signatures to this database.
