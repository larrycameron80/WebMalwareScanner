# OWASP Web Malware Scanner

## About

[Official OWASP Project Page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Web_Malware_Scanner_Project)

The OWASP Web Malware Scanner is a malware scanner for web applications. The goal is to be able to scan a web application using a community driven signature database. The Web Malware Scanner works by scanning each files of the web application for known malwares.

The Web Malware Scanner is not a vulnerability scanner, it is a malware scanner used to identify compromised web application installations. It can be used to identify compromised Wordpress, Joomla and other popular web application installations.

## Signature database

OWASP Web Malware Scanner uses a community-driven malware signature database to detect malwares. Signatures are found under the signatures/ folder. Each signature must be a text
file, that contains the following JSON object:

```
{
  "Database_Name": "Generic malware database",
  "Database_Signatures": [
    {
      "Malware_Name": "Generic PHP Malware",
      "Malware_Signatures": ["function.*for.*strlen.*isset"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The 'Database_Signatures' object must be an array of objects that must contains the malware name (Malware_Name) and the signature's array of regular expressions (Malware_Signatures). If the content of a file matches one of these regular expression, it will be marked as infected.

The signatures for regular expression matching are under 'signatures/matching/'.

OWASP Web Malware Scanner also performs md5 file checksums. MD5 file signatures are in 'signatures/checksum/'. A MD5 signature database must be a text file that contains the following JSON object:

```
{
  "Database_Name": "Generic malware hash database",
  "Database_Hash": [
    {
      "Malware_Name": "Zip.Trojan.Container",
      "Malware_Hash": "e27122ba785627fca79b4a19c8eea38b"
    }
  ]
}
```

The 'Database_Hash' object must be an array of objects that must contain the MD5 hash (Malware_Hash) and the Malware name (Malware_Name). If the MD5 checksum of a file matches one of these MD5 hashes, it will be marked as infected.

You are welcome to contribute to this project by adding new signatures to this database.
