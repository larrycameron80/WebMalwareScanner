        <h4>About</h4>
        <br/>
        OWASP Web Malware Scanner is a simple malware scanner for web applications. It can be used to identify compromised Wordpress, Joomla and other popular web application installations.
        <br/><br/>
        The Web Malware Scanner works by scanning each files of the web application for known malwares.
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Local scan</h4>
        <br/>

        Local scan are performed on the selected folder from the 'New local scan' item of the top menu. The application must have read access to all the files inside the selected folder.
        <br/><br/>
        Local scans can be paused manually and restarted on demand. When the application is closed, any active local scan will be paused automatically.
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Running from the terminal</h4>
        <br/>
        If you need to scan an installation from the terminal, simply run the following command:
        <br/><br/>
        <blockquote>
          <p>python wms.py /path/to/install /path/to/output.log</p>
        </blockquote>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Settings</h4>
        <br/>
        Scan options enables you to choose which parts of the scan will be executed during a local scan. This can change the speed of each scan depending on which options is enabled.
        <br/><br/>
        Automatic updates of the signature database are performed every time the application is started. This can be disabled using the Automatic updates settings.
        <br/><br/>
